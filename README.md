### Real-Time Collaborative Stateful Drawing

This project is a real-time collaborative drawing application built using Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects using Cursor. It enables multiple users to draw on a shared canvas simultaneously, with state synchronization across all participants.

Features
âœ… Real-time Collaboration â€“ Users can draw together on the same canvas, with updates reflecting instantly.
âœ… Durable Objects for State Management â€“ Ensures consistent state across users by managing drawing data centrally.
âœ… Cloudflare Workers for Scalability â€“ Serverless backend handles requests efficiently at the edge.
âœ… Low Latency Updates â€“ Fast communication using WebSockets or other real-time mechanisms.
âœ… Persistent Canvas State â€“ Drawings remain even if users disconnect and reconnect.

#### Tech Stack
 ðŸ”¥ Cloudflare Workers â€“ Serverless execution environment.
 ðŸ”¥ Cloudflare Durable Objects â€“ Manages shared state across multiple users.
 ðŸ”¥ WebSockets (or HTTP streaming) â€“ Enables real-time updates.
 ðŸ”¥ HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ Frontend for drawing interaction.

#### How It Works
User Joins a Session â†’ Each drawing session is assigned to a Durable Object.
Real-time Updates â†’ Draw events are sent via WebSockets and stored in the Durable Object.
State Persistence â†’ If a user disconnects, they can rejoin and see the existing drawing.

#### Setup & Deployment
1. Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account with Workers & Durable Objects enabled.
- Node.js & Wrangler CLI installed (npm install -g wrangler).
2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/jfokus-do-realtime-draw.git
cd drawtest
```
3. Configure Durable Objects
Modify wrangler.json to define the Durable Object binding:

```json
"durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{
      "name": "DRAWING_ROOM",
      "class_name": "DrawingDO"
    }]
  },
  "migrations": [{
    "tag": "v1",
    "new_classes": ["DrawingDO"]
  }]
```
4. Test locally 
```bash
npx wrangler dev --remote
```
5. Deploy to Cloudflare
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Usage
- Open the deployed URL in a browser.
- Start drawing on the shared canvas.
- Invite others to collaborate in real time!

####Future Improvements
ðŸš€ Multi-room support â€“ Allow users to create and join different drawing sessions.
ðŸš€ Undo/Redo functionality â€“ Track and revert actions.
ðŸš€ Mobile optimization â€“ Improve touch interactions for mobile users.
